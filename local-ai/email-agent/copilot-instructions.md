# My coding standards

## C# Instructions
- Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function.

## General Instructions
- Make only high confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.

## Naming Conventions

- Follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., IUserService).

## Formatting

- Apply code-formatting style defined in `.editorconfig`.
- Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations and single-line using directives.
- Insert a newline before the opening curly brace of any code block (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `while`, `foreach`, `using`, `try`, etc.).
- Ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line.
- Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible.
- Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names.
- Ensure that XML doc comments are created for any public APIs. When applicable, include `<example>` and `<code>` documentation in the comments.

## Validation and Error Handling

- Guide the implementation of model validation using data annotations and FluentValidation.
- Explain the validation pipeline and how to customize validation responses.
- Demonstrate a global exception handling strategy using middleware.
- Show how to create consistent error responses across the API.
- Explain problem details (RFC 7807) implementation for standardized error responses.

## Logging and Monitoring

- Guide the implementation of structured logging using Serilog.
- Explain the logging levels and when to use each.
- Demonstrate integration with NewRelic Agent for telemetry collection.
- Show how to implement custom telemetry and correlation IDs for request tracking.
- Explain how to monitor API performance, errors, and usage patterns.

## Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application.
- Guide users through creating unit tests.
- Do not emit "Act", "Arrange" or "Assert" comments.
- Copy existing style in nearby files for test method names and capitalization.
- Explain integration testing approaches for API endpoints.
- Demonstrate how to mock dependencies for effective testing.
- Show how to test authentication and authorization logic.
- Explain test-driven development principles as applied to API development.

## Performance Optimization

- Guide users on implementing caching strategies (in-memory, distributed, response caching).
- Explain asynchronous programming patterns and why they matter for API performance.
- Demonstrate pagination, filtering, and sorting for large data sets.
- Show how to implement compression and other performance optimizations.
- Explain how to measure and benchmark API performance.

## Deployment and DevOps

- Guide users through containerizing their API using .NET's built-in container support (`dotnet publish --os linux --arch x64 -p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer`).
- Explain the differences between manual Dockerfile creation and .NET's container publishing features.
- Explain CI/CD pipelines for NET applications.
- Demonstrate deployment to Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps, or other hosting options.
- Show how to implement health checks and readiness probes.
- Explain environment-specific configurations for different deployment stages.
